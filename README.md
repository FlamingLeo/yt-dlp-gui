# yt-dlp-gui
A graphical user interface for yt-dlp, made using Python and tkinter.

# Usage
- Install the requirements: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the application: `python3 main.py`

# Notes
This is a personal project I started a few years ago and left on hiatus sometime during 2022.
It's not meant to replace any other GUI made by others for yt-dlp.

While I have been using this program consistently for a while, there were always a few special options missing,
which meant I had to use the CLI. Not a problem by any means, but it kinda defeated the point of making a GUI in the
first place. That's why I finally decided to do a complete rewrite and expand upon my original project, more than a year
and a half later.

For legacy purposes, I uploaded the last version unchanged before the rewrite in the legacy folder.
